This repository has a complete Python CheatSheet to create different visualizations in Python. 

We have mainly used matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for creating visuals. Also, we have tried to include almost all the different types of parameters in creating the visuals and can be changed as and when requried. You can also take help from the official documentation of matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

Having a good understanding of data visualization and knowung how to create them using Python helps a lot in unpacking a lot of information that data has to offer. This repository will give you an in-depth knowledge of different charts and graphs and how to customize them according to your needs.

Please check out my post on medium to know more about when and where to use these visuals, and follow me for more :)
